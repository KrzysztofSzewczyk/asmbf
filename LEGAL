==[ Legal clarifications (since 15.01.2020)

 * asm2bf is licensed under the MIT license
 * contributed code's copyright is transferred to the project's owner
 * I didn't relinquish my rights to the source code of the snippets.
   This means, i hold a partial copyright on programs produced in asm2bf.
   According to the MIT license, so the only thing I want in return is credit.
   "the program was made using asm2bf (link)" is enough.

==[ Rationale

 1. asm2bf is undisputably licensed under the terms of the MIT license,
    which text is included in the repository root. I wanted to relicense it under
    GPLv3, and then relinquish my rights to the snippet code, but in the end I decided
    that relicensing is pointless at this point.
 2. this statements helps to keep the project cohesive and not a god damned mess.
    i'm not going to handle contributor wars of pulling code in and out of the repository.
    the only contributors that so far keep their intellectual property are Daniel Cristofani
    and aku. All future contributions from other contributors are transferred to me.
    obviously, this doesn't mean i'm robbing you from your code. you'll be recognized as a
    contributor to the project, and you can feel free to add yourself to the contributors
    list.
    actually owning the intellectual property makes decisions regarding the project much
    less complex and involved.
 3. i'll treat this restriction very leniently. i put some work in making asm2bf, and
    i don't want to think it was a mistake. i wrote multiple snippets, daniel cristofani
    optimized many of them, and it'd be unfair towards us two to take it away.
